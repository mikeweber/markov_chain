# Markov Chain
[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) A Markov chain is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.

This is a mental exercising to implement the Markov chain algorithm in Ruby.
